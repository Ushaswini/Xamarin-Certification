    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
    This homework assignment will continue modifying our <b>Fun Flag Facts</b> application and move the testable code out of the XAML code behind - and provide the logic for the screen as a fully segregated class. You should always do this as a best practice because it will allow you to put a different UI onto the app (for example a native iOS view) but keep the tested logic independent.

    <h2>Assets</h2>
    <p>
    This exercise includes a completed project in the <strong>Part 04 Resources</strong> folder if you'd like to check your work. If you need a starting point, you can use the <b>Completed</b> folder in the prior exercise.
    </p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>
    See if you can pull the basic flag state out of the code behind and put it into a shared class in the <b>FlagData</b> project. Think about how this class could use <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> to update the <code>BindingContext</code>. You will need to leave the event handlers in place for the buttons - but the actual logic can be shifted into a shared class, sometimes referred to as a "ViewModel". Check out the completed lab for a full implementation - it has a new class in the <b>FlagData</b> project named <code>FunFlactsViewModel</code>.
